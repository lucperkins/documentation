why: |
  As on-the-ground microservice practitioners are quickly realizing, the majority of operational problems that arise when moving to a distributed architecture are ultimately grounded in two areas: **networking** and **observability**. It is simply an orders of magnitude larger problem to network and debug a set of intertwined distributed services versus a single monolithic application.
